# Donation-and-Grant-System-Smart-Contract

A decentralized application that allows users to donate Ether to a contract and request grants from it.

## Description

This project is a decentralized donation and grant system built using Ethereum smart contracts. The system allows users to interact with a smart contract, donate Ether, and request grants directly from the contract. The contract is deployed on the Ethereum network, and the front-end interface is developed with React and ethers.js, allowing users to connect their MetaMask wallets, view the current balance of the contract in Ether, and make donations or grant requests.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/MetacrafterChris/SCM-Starter
```
* Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd donation-grant-system
```
* Install the necessary dependencies:
```
npm install
```
* Make sure you have MetaMask installed in your browser to connect your wallet.
* The application should be run in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for easy integration and management. 

### Executing program

To run the Donation and Grant System, follow these steps:

1. Open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the required dependencies (if not done already):
3. Open the terminal in VS Code and run the development server:
4. The application will now be running at `http://localhost:3000`. Open it in your browser and connect your MetaMask wallet to start interacting with the system.
5. You can then make donations and request grants via the interface.

## Help

If you encounter any issues while running the program or have questions, consider the following:

- Make sure your MetaMask wallet is connected and contains sufficient Ether for transactions.
- Ensure that the Ethereum network you're connected to is correct (mainnet, testnet, etc.).
